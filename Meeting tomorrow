- Next steps

Impress.js gives us all the necessary primitives that were outlined in section 2.5.

Therefore it will give us the perfect environment to transform the XML data that OMDoc provides us with into an interactive presentation.

In this step we will define several models of how data is presented within a frame.

Last but not least we need to create several models of how the temporal
and dependency relations between the different frames can be portrayed within Impress.js. one can be chosen to continue the main research question.

-links.
-arrows
-if we have a maximum of 4 dependencies we could arrange it around the slide of interest
- x axis for the narration of the lecture and primary path, y axis for continuation of the subject if it stretches multiple slides z axis for related content.
	-> this takes away the overview idea but provides everything else. Maybe have keywords that show up to point to related topics if h (help) is pressed?

-x and y axis for primary path. - branch out into subfield and show relatedness by lines

-help could be an additional view that shows where on a relatedness map for the topic we are.

-> always display a 'go back to...' link

- metaphor z axix - going into depth
