2) The authors assume that the readers are familiar with some technicalities (e.g. OMDoc, or impress.js), but is this the case of all potential participants at the conference? A brief description of these could be helpful.

I disagree with this comment. The intricacies of OMDoc and impress.js can be treated as a black box as the exact implementation of this system is irrelevant. As was pointed out during my thesis presentation, the system could be built with other tools and other input. - I believe we point out the needed functionality as needed. I have changed the wording slightly to point this out. What do you think? -> Please see the first paragraph of "Towards a More Effective Presentation Format"


1) It is however not completely clear what the input to this system is and how the system can be used by a presenter. 

Do you agree? I am not sure how much more detail they want.
