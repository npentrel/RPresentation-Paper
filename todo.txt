----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------

1) It is however not completely clear what the input to this system is and how the system can be used by a presenter.  

2) The authors assume that the readers are familiar with some technicalities (e.g. OMDoc, or impress.js), but is this the case of all potential participants at the conference? A brief description of these could be helpful.

3) Some figures are illegible (Fig. 5, 7 and 9 in particular). The authors should fix their dimensions so that one can read them easily.


----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

1) On Fig. 6. (Primary Narrative Path), do the slides 4 and 5 appear to be identical on purpose?

2) Bio item Tea06. points to a non-longer existing URL: http://cnx.org/aboutus/publications/ConnexionsWhitePaper.pdf
