Please take the time to double check your title and abstract before June 15th and the final version, based on the comments, before June 25th so that I can update the web-page.


----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------

1) It is however not completely clear what the input to this system is and how the system can be used by a presenter.  

2) The authors assume that the readers are familiar with some technicalities (e.g. OMDoc, or impress.js), but is this the case of all potential participants at the conference? A brief description of these could be helpful.

3) Some figures are illegible (Fig. 5, 7 and 9 in particular). The authors should fix their dimensions so that one can read them easily.


----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------
PAPER: 5
TITLE: Relational Presentation Using Semantic Closeness
AUTHORS: Naomi Pentrel and Michael Kohlhase


1) Nevertheless, it is not understandable why the same slides (basic measurements, right angle, calculating the area) are presented two times at different locations. To much redundancy should be avoided.    


----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

1) On Fig. 6. (Primary Narrative Path), do the slides 4 and 5 appear to be identical on purpose?

2) Bio item Tea06. points to a non-longer existing URL: http://cnx.org/aboutus/publications/ConnexionsWhitePaper.pdf

3) In the conclusion quite a few sentences are written from first person singular, while the paper is supposed to be a collaborative effort ;)
